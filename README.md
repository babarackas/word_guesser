# word_guesser

/*Code for word guesser attributed to teaching material.org http://www.teaching-materials.org/javascript/exercises/wordguesser.html 
The winnings calculations and total wrong were done by me.*/

I haven't figured out how to add up the wrong guesses and then stop the program.  
Perhaps this could be done with a do while loop but my programming skill aren't up to it quite yet.
